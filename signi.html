                <p id="p1">Mental health struggles among the youth are rising, and many young people suffer in silence.
                While physical abuse is often recognized, emotional neglect and the feeling of being unseen 
                or unheard are just as damaging. These silent battles can affect confidence, relationships, 
                and overall well-being.

                the importance of safe spaces where youth can express themselves, knowing that their struggles are 
                valid even if they don’t have visible scars.

                <h1>Why EchoSanctuary Matters</h1>
                <p>When young people are ignored or feel invisible in their own homes, the damage isn’t always obvious —
                    but it is real. Bottling up emotions can lead to anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and even 
                    long-term struggles with trust and relationships. Silence becomes a heavy burden, and many youth 
                    carry it alone for years without support.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h1>Why Youth Voices Matter</h1>
                <p>EchoSanctuary exists to break this cycle. When young people are encouraged to speak, share, and be heard, 
                    healing begins. A voice that was once silenced can grow into courage, leadership, and resilience. Every 
                    story told creates awareness, inspires empathy, and helps other youth realize they are not alone. By 
                    giving youth a platform to be heard, we are planting seeds for stronger, healthier communities.
